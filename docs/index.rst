The margin value method library
-------------------------------

The margin value method (:term:`MVM`) library is an open-source Python package consisting of libraries for defining complex engineering systems using a margin analysis network (MAN). The library provides class objects that represent the various components of the MAN and can be interfaced together to form a network. The library provides a number of computational tools to assess the ability of the system to absorb a change in its inputs (when for example a design requirement changes) by using excess margins.

Currently, ``mvmlib`` is designed for engineers with a python programming background to use since they would need to implement the behaviour models inline. A function-block modeling approach is being developed as a front-end for this library. The library includes a lot of modeling tools that are commonly used in engineering design such as probabilistic and fuzzy logic modeling tools to model uncertainty where it may exist.

The library also provides an intuitive and efficient way to store computations and results for later use and postprocessing as well as a number of visualization tools.
