.. _release-0.5.5:

0.5.5
=====

:Date: April 15, 2022

Fixes
-----
* ``Behaviour`` objects now support the ``train_inverse`` method (works only if the ``train_surrogate`` method has completed successfully) for training a surrogate model that inverts decided variables to any variable of choice (given by the ``key`` argument) and intermediate parameters (given by the ``intermediate`` attribute)
* ``Behaviour`` objects now support the ``inv_call`` which can be user defined (must define the ``intermediate`` and ``inverted`` attributes) or from the ``train_inverse`` method
* if ``use_estimate`` is False, the ``MarginNetwork`` must have equal number of decision and margin nodes associated with each other (1:1 ratio)
* The user-implemented ``forward`` method of the ``MarginNetwork`` object must include the ``outputs`` optional argument if using ``inv_call`` anywhere in the method
* Added error handling for ``train_surrogate`` function by rejecting NaN values during sampling of the blackbox

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* ``use_estimate`` argument of ``compute_impact`` method now relates to whether a surrogate is used or not for impact calculation
* ``train_surrogate`` argument of ``Behaviour`` class now needs the arguments ``n_i``, ``n_p``, ``n_dv``, and ``n_tt`` for each of the output parameters
* output of a decision node is given by the attribute ``output_value`` instead of ``decided_value``
